# Code of Conduct — Direct, Respectful, Adult

This project operates on an adult-to-adult basis. We value directness, respect, and getting work done. Be candid, focus on the work, and treat people as peers.

## Principles
- Respect peers: critique ideas and code, not people.
- Assume good intent first; ask for clarification before escalating.
- Be specific and actionable in feedback; favor facts over tone-policing.
- Be concise and timely; keep discussions about code, design, and outcomes.
- Disagree and commit: state objections clearly once; after a decision, move forward.

## Non‑Entitlement & Scope
- Open source here is a gift exchange, not a vendor contract. There is no SLA.
- Ask, don’t demand: requests are suggestions, not obligations; maintainers may say no or not respond.
- Build-for-use: features outside the maintainer’s use need a committed steward willing to maintain them.
- If disagreement persists, forking or maintaining an extension out‑of‑tree is acceptable.

## Not Acceptable
- Personal attacks, harassment, threats, doxxing, or sharing private info.
- Slurs or demeaning comments; repeated bad-faith derailment or flame-bait.
- Unwanted sexual content or advances.
- Spam or persistent off-topic promotion.
- Entitled behavior: demands, deadlines, or guilt‑tripping directed at volunteers; pressuring maintainers across channels.

Blunt feedback is welcome when it targets the work and remains professional. Crossing into personal abuse is not.

## Scope
This applies to all project spaces: issues, PRs, discussions, and any space where you represent the project.

## Resolving Issues
- Prefer direct resolution between involved contributors first.
- If that stalls or escalates, contact maintainer: george@lydakis.me
- For security-sensitive matters, use `.github/SECURITY.md`.

Maintainers act based on behavior and impact, not viewpoints. Possible actions: clarification, thread moderation/locks, temporary limits, or removal from project spaces for repeated or severe violations.

## Notes
- Keep evidence when reporting (links, context, impact). We aim to acknowledge within 3 business days.
