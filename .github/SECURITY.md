# Security Policy

We take the security of alloy-py seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Prefer GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting: go to the repo and click “Report a vulnerability”.
- Alternatively email: george@lydakis.me
- Please include detailed reproduction steps, affected versions, and impact.
- Do not open public issues for vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions
- Actively supported: the latest released minor series (e.g., 0.1.x)
- Older releases: best effort only for critical issues.

## Response Timeline (SLO)
- Acknowledgement: within 3 business days
- Triage & initial assessment: within 7 days
- Fix for high/critical: target 30 days (or coordinated disclosure date)

## Disclosure
We follow coordinated disclosure. Once a fix is available, we will publish a security advisory with credits.

## PGP / Encryption
If you need encryption, mention it in your report and we will coordinate a key exchange.
