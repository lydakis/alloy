# Alloy (Python)

Python for logic. English for intelligence.

Alloy lets you declare typed AI commands in Python, wire up tools, and route to multiple model providers with a consistent API.

- Typed commands via `@command(output=...)`
- Simple `ask(...)` namespace for quick prompts
- Tool calling with contracts and validation
- Multi‑provider backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama)

See Getting Started for installation and a 2‑minute tutorial.
