# Enforcing Outputs (moved)

This page has moved to the canonical Structured Outputs guide:

- Guide → Structured Outputs: guide/structured-outputs.md

Notes
- Alloy enforces typed outputs via provider‑native structured outputs (JSON Schema). See the Guide page for supported shapes and strict‑mode behavior.
