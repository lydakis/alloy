# 90 — Advanced

- Purpose: Larger flows and operational concerns.
- When to use: Planning + execution, observability, simple evals.
- Notes: Start simple; scale only when needed.

Files:
- `01_deep_agents.py` — dynamic deep-agents pattern (planning, subagents, filesystem)
- `02_deep_research.py` — minimal plan/execute example
- `03_multi_modal.py` — OCR an image (pillow+pytesseract) and summarize
- `04_observability.py` — timing wrapper
- `05_eval_simple.py` — tiny exact-match eval
